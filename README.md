Some of (hopefully the most of) small scripts of my interest that are not necessarily linked to any official project.

* case-control_bias.R - a brief script that explores the how causal structure affects the effect conditioning on control variable (Z) has on the estimate of the effect of predictor (X) on outcome (Y) when Z is unconditionally associated with Y but not with X (inspired to write this one when reading Wysocki et al. (2022, https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/25152459221095823), the simulations are inspired by Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking course 2022 (https://youtu.be/NSuTaeW6Orc?t=3652)
